Thanks for trying Freemail!

This is the first release of Freemail, and so may (read: does) have bugs that I haven't found yet. Please do report them at http://bugs.freenetproject.org/.

Using Freemail
==============
You can compile from source:

# ./gradlew clean test jar

run with --newaccount <account name> to create an account, eg:

Once you've done one of those steps, create an account (replace java -jar with however you run jar files on your system):

java -jar Freemail.jar --newaccount fred

Use --passwd <account> <passwd> to set your password

java -jar Freemail.jar --passwd fred fredspassword

Run:

java -jar Freemail.jar

(You can also specify the address (host) and port of your Freenet node
using -h and -p respectively, if they are not the defaults).

Set up your email client to point at IMAP port 3143 and SMTP port 3025.



Feel free to Freemail me on dave@dbkr.freemail! If that doesn't work, my real email address is dbkr@freenetproject.org.

Good luck!
